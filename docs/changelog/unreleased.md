# Unreleased

Notes on merged features that have no release page yet. `/worca-changelog` folds
them into the next page and empties this file.

## Shape it first (experimental)

**Plan it before it builds.**

Worca now shapes a thin or large task first: at most 3 questions, a plan written for the perspectives you pick, your approval, and then the run only builds. A task too big for one change is cut into slices, each with its own run, branch and pull request, stacked one on the next.

## Watch PR fix runs in the chat

**The chat that opened a pull request sees its fix runs.**

A pull-request card in Ask Worca now shows the PR's Watch PR status, live. When Watch PR (or Resolve) starts a fix run
on that PR, the chat gets a live run card for it by itself — what started it (conflicts, failing checks, review
comments) and, at the end, whether the fix was pushed — even when the chat was closed.
