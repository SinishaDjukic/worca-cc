# Unreleased

Notes on merged features that have no release page yet. `/worca-changelog` folds
them into the next page and empties this file.

## Shape it first (experimental)

**Plan it before it builds.**

Worca now shapes a thin or large task first: at most 3 questions, a plan written for the perspectives you pick, your approval, and then the run only builds. A task too big for one change is cut into slices, each with its own run, branch and pull request, stacked one on the next.

## Run presets (beta)

Save a New run setup as a named preset, pick it later, type a prompt and start: the run gets the preset's choices for that run only, and the project's settings never change. Read it: [Run presets](../run-presets.md)

- Every new run keeps its setup, and a finished run's page has **Save as preset** to turn it into a preset.
- The Chat home shows your presets as one-click chips under **Start from a preset**.
- Schedules follow their preset, `worca run --preset NAME --prompt "…"` starts one from the terminal, and Ask Worca proposes runs from your presets. Run presets are now in beta and on by default.

## Watch PR fix runs in the chat

**The chat that opened a pull request sees its fix runs.**

A pull-request card in Ask Worca now shows the PR's Watch PR status, live. When Watch PR (or Resolve) starts a fix run
on that PR, the chat gets a live run card for it by itself — what started it (conflicts, failing checks, review
comments) and, at the end, whether the fix was pushed — even when the chat was closed.

## Runs redesign

**One run model, one look, everywhere.**

Runs, Shaper features and Run-after chains are now one thing on every surface: the Runs list, the chat card and the
run and group pages draw the same dot, the same status line and the same actions. A **?** marks a run that needs you
and a **!** one that failed. The list filters and groups from one View menu, rows can be selected and stopped,
archived or deleted together, and any run can join a group. A server restart now pauses live runs and resumes them.
Your existing runs, features, chains, archived runs and schedules carry over, and old links still open.
